# Facade Pattern Challenge:

This pattern is implemented to mask over-complexity. By isolating the information being used and applying it within its own class, code is made more readable and maintainable.  In this challenge you've inherited 3 hellishly monsterous classes and tasked with the job of isolating 3 key ingredients to make a great camp fire. 

## What you are supposed to do:

1. Read Chapt. 4 in Design Patterns in C# by Steven John Metsker and read through the material on the Dev Book Club site (http://devbookclub.io/2016/09/19/chapter-4-facades/).

2. Implement the Facade Pattern to make this code easier to read and maintain by creating a class specific to the need.
